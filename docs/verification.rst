Verification
============

The International Energy Agency has sponsored a number of international
research collaborations to further the state of wind energy technology
and tools. One of these, Task 30: Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration
(OC3), shared a spar design among many participants to compare
performance as modeled by differed tool sets. A description of the OC3
spar is provided in :cite:`OC3`. Since it is already a well-studied geometry, the
OC3 spar design was selected as the focus of verification for
*FloatingSE*. As part of the Task 30 effort, an ANSYS model of the OC3
spar, using shell elements combined with stiffeners and bulkheads, was
also generated. This was taken as the *truth* standard for comparison.

Mass Properties
---------------

The first step in the verification exercise was to ensure that the mass
properties of the spar predicted by *FloatingSE* matched those
calculated by ANSYS. The comparison is shown in 
:numref:`tbl_verify-static`, where *FloatingSE* summary mass estimates are
within :math:`1\%` error of ANSYS. To ensure that these mass property
calculations remain consistent over time despite changes in the
underlying code, this OC3 mass properties comparison was installed
within the *FloatingSE* test framework.

Static Loading Stress
---------------------

Without wind and waves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the mass property comparison showing little difference between
ANSYS and *FloatingSE* calculations, the verification proceeded to
static cases. The spar was simulated in quiescent air and water (no
wind, waves, or current), which isolated the weight of the turbine and
hydrostatic pressure forces as the only sources on the substructure. The
effective von Mises stress, as calculated by *FloatingSE*, was compared
to the ANSYS model. This comparison, as a function of the z-coordinate
along the spar axis (:math:`z=0` at the waterline), is shown in :numref:`fig_verify`. The *FloatingSE* stress calculation matches that of ANSYS
nearly exactly over the top half of the spar, but deviates by
approximately 5â€“10% towards the bottom half of the spar. In the bottom
half of the spar, *FloatingSE* actually over-predicts the stress, a more
conservative estimate, which is the preferable approach in a
low-fidelity cost and sizing model.

At this time, more complicated loading cases, with wind and wave loading
included, have not been performed.

Hydrodynamic Verification
-------------------------

The rigid body modes predicted by *FloatingSE* were compared against a
FAST model of the OC3 spar. FAST was used as the truth solution in this
case because it more accurately handles mooring dynamics than the ANSYS
structural model and more accurately captures hydrodynamic phenomenon.
The results are shown in :numref:`tbl_verify-fast`. The errors in the
surge, sway, roll, and pitch frequencies are 11-12%. *FloatingSE*
actually estimates the heave mode frequency quite accurately, to less
than 1% error, but is significantly off in estimating the yaw mode
frequency. This was deemed acceptable as there is no focus on the yaw
DOF in *FloatingSE*.
