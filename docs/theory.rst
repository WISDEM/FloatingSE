Design Load Cases (DLCs)
------------------------

The user must specify the metocean conditions that drive the wind and
wave loads upon the floating substructure. *FloatingSE* currently only
uses the single load case of maximum thrust coincident with maximum wave
loading to drive the substructure design. The assumption is that this
load case would be the driver for substructure sizing and stability.
Ideally, multiple DLCs and metocean conditions would be used for design
optimization. The capability to optimize over multiple DLCs will be
added to future versions of the model. By not currently including a
formal set of IEC DLCs, the conceptual designs derived in this work
should be considered preliminary and subject to extensive revision once
other load cases, and higher-fidelity analysis, is brought to bear.

Load Path
---------

As with other WISDEM models, the primary simplification in *FloatingSE*
is the treatment of all loads as pseudo-static. This approximation
significantly reduces computational time and resources, since an
accurate calculation of dynamic loads requires more sophisticated
numerical tools and simulations. However, dynamic effects can still
dominate drive component sizing for floating platforms, thus the static
loading assumption gives a rough approximation of the total loading.
Furthermore, fatigue effects and structural lifetime estimates are also
excluded for now, but could be incorporated in future developments.

A floating wind turbine undergoes loading from a number of sources. The
primary loading source for the tower comes from the aerodynamic loads
induced by the rotor. The substructure must resist the combination of
both rotor loads and hydrodynamics loads, with the latter becoming more
and more important as water depth and wave heights increase.
*FloatingSE*, together with other WISDEM modules, accounts for these two
dominant load sources, as well as the self-loading of gravity loads.
Other sources of loading, such as installation loads, accidental loads,
vortex-induced vibrations, ice, and seismic loads are ignored.

Wind and Wave Loads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wind drag loads are applied to the tower body and the upper part of the
substructure that extends above the waterline. They are not applied to
connecting truss members that may be part of the substructure geometry.
These drag loads are computed assuming the tower and columns are smooth
circular cross-sections and that the drag coefficient can be selected as
a function of the flow Reynolds number :cite:`Roshko`. The aerodynamic drag force is a
function of height, since the wind profile and cross-sectional geometry
varies along that dimension. For the wind profile, the standard
power-law scaling is used,

.. math:: U_a(z) = U_{ref}\left(\frac{z}{z_{ref}}\right)^{\alpha}\quad,

where :math:`U_a(z)` is the wind velocity as a function of height,
:math:`U_{ref}` is a reference wind speed measured at a reference
height, :math:`z_{ref}`, and :math:`\alpha` is the shear exponent used
in the power-law approximation of wind profiles. The wind profile then
feeds the aerodynamic drag, Reynolds number, and drag coefficient,

.. math::

   \label{eqn:drag}
     dF(z) = \frac{1}{2} \rho_a U_a^2(z) d(z) c_d(Re) dz;\qquad
     Re_d = \frac{\rho_a U_a(z) d(z)}{\mu_a}\quad,

where :math:`Re_d` is the Reynolds number based on diameter,
:math:`\rho_a` and :math:`\mu_a` are the density and viscosity of air,
:math:`d(z)` is the diameter of the column as a function of height,
:math:`c_d` is the 2-D drag coefficient, and :math:`dF(z)` is the force
per unit length in the z-direction.

Wave drag loads arise from similar processes, but are computed using
Morison’s equation, a semi-empirical expression that predicts the total
hydrodynamic loads. It is comprised of two components, one for viscous
drag contributions and another for inertial effects (which includes
incident, diffracted, and radiated wave effects). For flow past
structures with circular cross sections, Morison’s equation for force
per unit length (:math:`dF(z)`) takes the form,

.. math::

   \label{eqn:morison}
     dF(z) = \frac{\pi d^2(z)}{4} \rho_w C_m \dot{U}_w(z)dz + \frac{1}{2} \rho_w U_w^2(z) d(z) c_d(Re)dz\quad,

where :math:`C_m` is the added mass coefficient (assumed to be
:math:`C_m=2`), :math:`U_w(z)` is the current speed as a function of
height, :math:`\dot{U}_w(z)` is the acceleration as a function of
height, and the Reynolds number is computed by substituting in the
appropriate properties for water,

.. math:: Re_d = \frac{\rho_w U_w(z) d(z)}{\mu_w}\quad.

To compute Morison’s equation, expressions for local fluid velocity and
acceleration are required. Wave particle velocity (not the same as the
bulk velocity of the wave) is assumed to follow linear (Airy) wave
theory

.. math::

   \label{eqn:Uwave}
   U_w(z) = a\omega\frac{\cosh\left[\kappa\left(z + D \right)\right]}{\sinh\left(\kappa D\right)}\cosh\left(\kappa x -
     \omega t\right);
   \qquad \omega=\frac{2\pi}{T} = \sqrt{ g \kappa \tanh\left(\kappa
       D\right) } \quad,

where :math:`\omega` is the circular frequency, :math:`T` is the wave
period, :math:`a` is the wave amplitude (half of the significant wave
height), :math:`D` is the total water depth, :math:`g` is the
acceleration of gravity, and :math:`\kappa` is the wave number
numerically computed from the dispersion relationship given as the last
expression in Equation [eqn:Uwave]. Note that the horizontal particle
velocity varies in time and space (by the :math:`\kappa x - \omega t`)
term. Thus, the individual particles in the wave are also accelerating
at different rates,

.. math::

   \label{eqn:Awave}
   \dot{U}_w(z) = a\omega^2\frac{\cosh\left[\kappa\left(z + D \right)\right]}{\sinh\left(\kappa D\right)}\sinh\left(\kappa x -
     \omega t\right)\quad.

For simplicity, *FloatingSE* only considers the maximum velocity and
acceleration at a given height, and makes a conservative assumption that
they are concurrent in time and space. This essentially means ignoring
the :math:`\kappa x - \omega t` term, since the maximum of any
hyperbolic sine or cosine term is one.

Rotor Nacelle Assembly (RNA) Loads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From a quasi-steady-state point of view, the RNA loads reduce to three
forces and three moments along the main coordinate axes :cite:`JacketSE`. The thrust is
the biggest force responsible for the bending moment distribution along
the tower and loads on the substructure. There is the additional effect
of the gravitational load caused by the offset of the RNA center of mass
from the tower centerline. This effect is more pronounced for downwind
turbines than upwind turbines, but is included regardless. *FloatingSE*
does not compute the force and moment components directly, but rather
accepts them as inputs from other WISDEM modules or from the user
directly.

Structural Analysis
-------------------

The analysis tool, `Frame3DD <http://frame3dd.sourceforge.net>`_, is an open-source tool for static and
dynamic structural analysis of 2-D and 3-D frames and trusses with
elastic and geometric stiffness. It computes the static deflections,
reactions, internal element forces, natural frequencies, and modal
shapes using direct stiffness and mass assembly :cite:`frame3dd`. The WISDEM toolkit
developed a python interface, `pyFrame3DD <http://www.github.com/WISDEM/pyFrame3DD>`_, to avoid the use of
intermediate input and output text files. The integration of all loads
happens within `Frame3DD <http://frame3dd.sourceforge.net>`_, where the whole floating turbine load path,
from the rotor to the keel of the substructure, is modeled with
Timoshenko frame elements :cite:`timoshenko`.

Discretization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the finite element structural analysis of the substructure, the
discretization of the main columns into a handful of sections is still
too coarse to capture the appropriate physics. Long slender components,
such as the tower and substructure columns, are broken up into a
three-times finer discretization than the physical cans that they are
actually made of. The sectional and nodal variables are re-sampled at
this finer spacing. These additional discretization points give greater
resolution of internal forces and natural frequencies. Substructure
pontoons are represented as single frame elements. Frame elements are
described by their cross sectional properties (area, moments of inertia,
modulus of elasticity, and mass density) and starting and ending nodes.
For simple geometries, such as pontoons with tubular cross sections,
these properties are straightforward calculations. For the turbine
tower, tubular cross section properties are also used, albeit at a finer
discretization. For substructure columns, it is assumed that the
permanent or variable ballast and bulkheads are not load-bearing, so
tubular cross section properties are also used to represent the column
shell. However, the material mass density of the frame element is scaled
to reflect the true mass of the whole section, including ballast, to
ensure that gravity loads are captured correctly.

For the tubular cross sections, the critical properties needed by
`Frame3DD <http://frame3dd.sourceforge.net>`_ given user inputs of diameter, :math:`d`, and tube (or wall)
thickness, :math:`t`, are,

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
     \textrm{Outer radius, } r_o &= d/2\\
     \textrm{Inner radius, } r_i &= r_o - t\\
     \textrm{Material area, } A &= \pi \left( r_o^2 - r_i^2 \right)\\
     \textrm{Bending second moment of area, } I_{xx} &= I_{yy} = \frac{\pi}{4}\left( r_o^4 - r_i^4 \right)\\
     \textrm{Torsion second moment of area, } I_{zz} &= J_0 = I_{xx} + I_{yy}\\
     \textrm{Shear area, } A_{s} &= A / \left[ 1.124235 + 0.055610\left(\frac{r_i}{r_o}\right) +
              1.097134\left(\frac{r_i}{r_o}\right)^2 - 0.630057\left(\frac{r_i}{r_o}\right)^3 \right]\\
     \textrm{Bending modulus, } S &= I_{xx} / r_o \\
     \textrm{Torsion modulus (shear constant), } C &= I_{zz} / r_o\end{aligned}

Note that the shear area expression is an empirical relationship as
opposed to an analytical expression.

Loads
~~~~~

All of the loads described above are integrated together within
`Frame3DD <http://frame3dd.sourceforge.net>`_. These loads include,

-  Rotor-nacelle-assembly loads (thrust, moments, etc)

-  Mooring line force

-  Wind and wave loading

-  Gravity loads (weight distribution)

-  Hydrostatic pressure loads, including buoyancy

The forces, moments, and mass properties of the rotor-nacelle assembly
(RNA) are inputs to *FloatingSE* (mass properties are assumed to be
relative to the tower top position). It assumed that the RNA is a rigid
body with respect to the tower modes and the mass properties, forces,
and moments, are applied to the corresponding node in the model. The
forces along each mooring line are applied to the connection point nodes
on the structure. The wind and wave forces per unit length in Equations
[eqn:drag] and [eqn:morison] are applied as trapezoidally varying loads
along the column elements. Other loads applied to the structure include
the gravity loads, and the buoyancy acting on the submerged elements.

Boundary Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple boundary conditions are applied to the structure. The mooring
system stiffness matrix (linearized about the neutral position) is
applied at the mooring connection nodes. However, even with the mooring
stiffness, the finite element analysis would otherwise still regard the
structure as unrestrained and incapable of supporting any static loads.
Thus, in order to successfully compute stress and buckling limits in a
well-posed problem, an additional rigid boundary condition (in all 6
DOF) is imposed at the bottom node of the main column.

Outputs
~~~~~~~

Structural analysis outputs include mass properties of the structure,
member stresses, and summary forces and moments on the body. Mass
properties include the total mass of the floating turbine and the mass
of the substructure itself. The calculations also allow for easy
computation of the center of mass of the structure (not accounting for
variable ballast) and the center of buoyancy (centroid of the submerged
volume). The first two natural frequencies of the structure are also
computed to compare against the range of standard wave frequencies and
rotor passing frequencies (1P and 3P). Next, the reaction forces and
moments at the boundary node at the keel are taken as the total loading
on the structure. These are used later in the static stability
calculations to ensure that the mooring lines provide adequate restoring
force and moment. Finally, the axial and shear forces within each frame
element are extracted and converted to stresses using cross-sectional
properties. These element member follow the sign convention in :numref:`fig_frameCS`,

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
     \sigma_z &= \frac{N_z}{A} - \frac{\sqrt{M_x^2 + M_y^2}}{S}\\
     \tau_{z\theta} &= \frac{T_z}{C} + \frac{\sqrt{V_x^2 + V_y^2}}{A_s}\end{aligned}

where :math:`N` is the axial force (tension or compression), :math:`T`
is the torsional moment, :math:`V` is the shear force, :math:`M` is the
bending moment, :math:`\sigma_z` is the axial stress, and
:math:`\tau_{z\theta}` is the shear stress across axial and hoop
principle directions.

Hoop stress of the tower is estimated from the dynamic pressure of the
wind loads using the Eurocode method :cite:`Eurocode`. Hoop stress of the submerged
columns is determined using the dynamic and static pressure heads of the
water.

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
     \sigma_{\theta,Euro} &= k_w q_{max} \frac{d-t}{2t};\qquad q_{max} =
                            \frac{1}{2}\rho_a U_a^2\\
     \sigma_{\theta,hydro} &= \left(q_{max}+p_{hydro}\right) \frac{d-t}{2t};\qquad q_{max} =
                             \frac{1}{2}\rho_w U_w^2\\
     p_{hydro} &= \rho_w g \left( a\frac{\cosh\left[\kappa\left(z + D \right)\right]}{\cosh\left(\kappa D\right)} - z\right)\end{aligned}

where :math:`\sigma_{\theta}` is the hoop stress, :math:`q_{max}` is the
maximum dynamic pressure on a cross-section, and :math:`p_{hydro}` is
the hydrostatic pressure with contributions from wave motion and the
static head. In the Eurocode method, :math:`k_w` is the dynamic pressure
factor for hoop stress calculation using cylinder dimensions and an
external pressure buckling factor. Note that the argument, :math:`(z)`,
was dropped from many of the terms without losing generality.

Code Compliance as Utilizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the stress components of all structural members are computed, they
are compared against design code standards for compliance, and serve as
design constraints when conducting optimization. Multiple code standards
are used across all components. For all columns, the tower, and
substructure pontoons, stress components (axial, shear, and hoop) are
combined into a von Mises, equivalent, stress,

.. math::

   \sigma_{vm} = \sqrt{\sigma_a^2 + \sigma_{\theta}^2 -
       \sigma_a\sigma_{\theta} + 3\tau_{a\theta}^2}

where :math:`\sigma_{vm}` is the von Mises stress, :math:`\sigma_a` is
the axial stress, :math:`\tau_{a\theta}` is the shear stress across
axial and hoop principle directions. and :math:`\sigma_{\theta}` is
chosen as the relevant hoop stress. The von Mises stress is compared
against the yield stress, :math:`\sigma_y`, and a safety factor as a
utilization criterion.

Main column, offset column, and tower segment stresses and geometry are
also evaluated against a shell buckling criterion published by :cite:`Eurocode` and a
global buckling criterion published by :cite:`Germanischer`. Note that the implementation of
the Eurocode buckling is modified slightly so as to produce continuously
differentiable output. See :cite:`JacketSE` for a more detailed exposition.

For submerged columns, additional code standard utilization ratios are
taken from the American Petroleum Institute, Bulletin 2U (specifically the procedure outlined in
Appendix B) :cite:`api2U`. These standards also apply shell and general buckling
criterion with a margin of safety in a manner that accounts for
stiffeners and the common buckling modes of submerged structures. Future
efforts will also apply Bulletin 2V, the standards for plates, to the
legs that support taut mooring lines.

Mooring Lines
-------------

The quasi-steady mooring system analysis is handled by the external
`Mooring Analysis Program (MAP++) <https://nwtc.nrel.gov/MAP>`_ library :cite:`MAP`, which has convenient Python
bindings to access the simulation output, bundled into the WISDEM
`pyMAP <http://www.github.com/WISDEM/pyMAP>`_ module. `MAP++ <https://nwtc.nrel.gov/MAP>`_ is designed to model the steady-state forces on a
Multi-Segmented, Quasi-Static (MSQS) mooring line. Seabed contact,
seabed friction, and multi-element mooring lines with arbitrary
connection configurations can be analyzed. `MAP++ <https://nwtc.nrel.gov/MAP>`_ inputs include sea
depth, geometry descriptions of the mooring line connections, and
material properties of the lines. For chain and rope-based cables, these
material properties are not easily derived and would be typically
provided by a manufacturer. We borrow from the approach of the popular
Orcina OrcaFlex software :cite:`orca` and use the following expressions,

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   MBL &= 2.74\times 10^7  d^2 \left(44 - 80d\right) \,[N] \\
   mass &= 19.9\times 10^3 d^2 \,[kg/m]\\
   A &= 2\left(\pi d^2 / 4 \right)\,[m^2]\\
   EA &= 8.54\times 10^{10} d^2\,[N]\\
   cost &= 3.415\times 10^4 d^2 \,[USD]\end{aligned}

where :math:`MBL` is minimum breaking load, :math:`d` is the diameter of
a single half-chain link, :math:`A` is the chain cross-sectional area,
:math:`E` is the Young’s modulus, :math:`EA` is the axial stiffness.
When conducting optimization, the expression for :math:`MBL` is poorly
posed due to its limited range of diameter applicability, so a linear
fit is used instead,

.. math:: MBL = 1000 \max\left(1.0, -5445.3 + 176972.7 d\right)

	  
.. _static-label:

Hydrostatic Stability
---------------------

Neutral Buoyancy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any floating body requires enough water displacement to create
sufficient buoyancy force such that the body stays afloat in the most
extreme loading and environmental conditions. This level of displacement
would otherwise be overkill for more benign loading conditions. Since a
floating turbine is designed for a constant hub height, variable amounts
of ballast are required to maintain a neutrally buoyant system for all
operating conditions. The variable ballast is simply ocean water that is
pulled in or pumped out of holding areas within the substructure
columns.

In *FloatingSE*, the variable ballast water mass is calculated as the
difference between the total mass of displaced water and the total mass
of the floating turbine. This mass is then divided by the water density
to obtain the variable ballast volume, which is then compared to the
frustum shell cross section profile above the permanent ballast to
determine the height of the water ballast within the column. Once this
is determined, the final center of mass of the system can be determined.

Surge/Sway Stability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Surge and sway stability is not actively tracked over the coarse of a
load case. Instead the total surge force on the structure is calculated
at the initial conditions and compared to the restoring force of the
mooring system at the maximum allowable surge offset, which is specified
by the user.

The surge direction is assumed to be aligned with the wind vector, which
is aligned with the :math:`x`-axis. Since the rotor yaw is assumed to be
:math:`0^{\circ}`, the surge forces on the turbine include the rotor
thrust and the wind and wave drag on the tower and substructure. The
final surge force over the whole structure is taken from the
:math:`x`-direction reaction force of the reaction node in `Frame3DD <http://frame3dd.sourceforge.net>`_.

The restoring force is calculated as the smallest possible restoring
force after a displacement in any angular direction in the mooring
model. Since the alignment of the mooring lines relative to the incoming
wind direction is arbitrary, a maximum offset is simulated at
:math:`2^{\circ}` increments around the unit circle. Also recorded in
this survey is the maximum mooring line tension in any line, in any
direction, for comparison against the minimum breaking load value,

.. math::

   F_{x,restore} = \min_{i\in a} F_{x,i}\quad {\mathbb{T}}_{moor} = \max_{l\in L,i\in a} {\mathbb{T}}_{l,i}\,;
   \qquad L=\left\{1,2\ldots nlines\right\}, \, a= \left\{0^{\circ}, 2^{\circ}\ldots 360^{\circ}\right\}

where :math:`F_x` is the surge force and :math:`{\mathbb{T}}` is the
tension. If restoring force at this maximum offset is greater than the
surge force applied, then the system is considered stable in surge.
Since the wind and wave profiles are essentially 2-D in the :math:`x-z`
plane, the sway stability is given the same status as surge stability.

Pitch Stability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The approach to pitch stability determination is similar to that of
surge stability. The total pitching moment on the floating turbine is
calculated and compared to the restoring moment at the maximum allowable
angle of heel. If the restoring moment at this max heel angle is greater
than the pitching moment applied, the system is said to be statically
stable in pitch.

Similar to the surge force calculation, the total pitching moment is
determined from the reaction moment at the boundary condition in the
`Frame3DD <http://frame3dd.sourceforge.net>`_ analysis. The pitching moment has contributions from the wind
and wave loads on the structure, the rotor forces and torques, the
buoyancy forces on the submerged substructure, and the off-center weight
of components (e.g. the RNA).

The restoring pitching moment has two primary contributions. The first
is from the mooring lines. Similar to the surge force calculation, here
the floating turbine is deflected in pitch by the maximum allowable heel
angle and the mooring forces are recorded. The restoring moment
contribution from the mooring system is computed as,

.. math:: {\mathbf{M_{moor}}} = \sum_i {\mathbf{r_{cm-l}}} \times {\mathbf{F_l}}

where :math:`r_{cm-l}` is the vector from the center of mass to the
mooring connection, and :math:`F_l` is the force applied by the
:math:`l`-.5exmooring line. As above, :math:`F_l` is taken as the
minimum set over the possible orientations of the mooring lines relative
to the direction.

.. _fig_metaB:
.. figure::  figs/metacenterB.png
    :height: 500px
    :align: center

    Static stability of floating offshore wind turbine in pitched position.


The second contributing restoring moment comes from the motion of the
center of buoyancy away from alignment with the center of mass. This is
a standard calculation in naval architecture :cite:`thiagarajan2014` and is diagrammed in Figure
[fig:metacenter]. In this diagram, the center of mass is denoted,
:math:`G`, the center of buoyancy is :math:`B`, and the metacenter is
:math:`M`. In neutral conditions (Figure [fig:metacenter]a), all of
these points are vertically aligned.

As the structure lists or heels, the center of buoyancy shifts toward
the side of the structure that is more submerged (from :math:`B` to
:math:`B'`) and the buoyancy force no longer passes through the center
of mass. Instead, the buoyancy force passes through the metacenter with
an effective moment arm of :math:`GZ` from the center of mass (Figure
[fig:metacenter]b). The metacenter is defined as the common point
through which the buoyancy force acts as it pitches through small
displacements, for bodies with sufficient freeboard margin.

The metacenteric height, :math:`GM` is most easily calculated as an
offset from the center of buoyancy (:math:`BM`) by,

.. math:: h_{meta} = M - G = GM = BM + BG;\quad BM = \frac{I_w}{V}

where :math:`BG`, the distance between the centers of buoyancy and
gravity is easily calculated, :math:`I_w` is the second moment of area
of the substructure waterplane (with units of ) and :math:`V` is the
total volume of displacement (with units of ). Note that for
semisubmersible type geometries, :math:`I_w` is calculated with the
parallel axis theorem for all of the columns at the waterplane,

.. math:: I_w = \sum_i \left( I_{w,i} + S_ir_i^2 \right)

where :math:`S_i` is the waterplane cross sectional area of the
:math:`i`-.5excolumn and :math:`r_i` is the distance from the waterplane
centroid to the :math:`i`-.5excolumn centroid.

The restoring moment is then the buoyancy force acting through the
restoring arm, :math:`GZ`,

.. math:: M_{meta} = F_B GZ = F_B GM \sin \varphi

where :math:`\varphi` is the angle of heel.

For this reason, the metacenter must be located above the center of mass
for static stability. This condition is imposed on the design as a
constraint. Note that the total volume of displacement, and the
subsequent buoyancy force, is not recalculated in the perturbed
configuration. It is assumed that the angles of deflection are small and
that there is sufficient freeboard and design symmetry such that the
total displacement is constant.

The total restoring pitching moment is then the sum of two
contributions,

.. math:: M_{y,restore} = M_{y,moor} + M_{meta}

Hydrodynamic Stability
----------------------

Floating bodies are typically modeled, for small motions and linearized
behavior, as a second-order differential system with mass, damping, and
spring stiffness terms,

.. math::

   \left({\mathbf{M}} + {\mathbf{A}}\right)\ddot{{\mathbf{x}}} + {\mathbf{C}}\dot{{\mathbf{x}}} +
     {\mathbf{K}} = {\mathbf{F}}\left( t \right)

where :math:`{\mathbf{x}}\in{\mathbb{R}}^6` is the six-degree of freedom
vector (commonly ordered as 1-surge, 2-sway, 3-heave, 4-roll, 5-pitch,
6-yaw), :math:`{\mathbf{M}}` is the mass matrix, :math:`{\mathbf{A}}` is
the added mass matrix, :math:`{\mathbf{C}}` is the damping matrix, and
:math:`{\mathbf{K}}` is the stiffness matrix. The right-hand side of the
equation captures the time-dependent summation of all forces.

As a low-fidelity, quasi-static sizing and cost module, *FloatingSE*
does not attempt to capture all of the matrix entries or forcing terms
of the hydrodynamics. A more sophisticated time- or frequency-domain
solver, where these quantities are calculated, may be linked or included
into *FloatingSE* in the future. Nevertheless, it does attempt to
compute the diagonal entries of the mass and stiffness matrices in order
to derive the rigid body natural frequencies of the system,

.. math::

   f_i = \frac{\omega_i}{2\pi} =
     \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{K_{ii}}{M_{ii}+A_{ii}}}, \quad \forall i \in
     \left[1\ldots6\right]

where :math:`f_i` are the frequencies of the eigenmodes and
:math:`\omega_i` is the circular frequency. The mass matrix diagonal
entries, :math:`M_{ii}`, are simply the mass and moments of inertia of
the whole system,

.. math:: M_{11} = M_{22} = M_{33} = m_{sys};\quad M_{44} = I_{xx,sys};\quad M_{55} = I_{yy,sys};\quad M_{66} = I_{zz,sys};

Where the coordinate system notation is consistent with that of Figure
[fig:diagram].

The added mass matrix diagonal entries are evaluated via standard strip
theory for the tapered vertical columns. The added mass for the system
is a summation over the columns, using the parallel axis theorem for the
rotational degrees of freedom. Pontoon contributions to system added
mass are currently ignored. The column quantities are calculated as,

.. math::

   A_{11} = A_{22} = \rho V;\quad A_{33} = 
     \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{8}{3} \rho \max \left[ R^3(z)\right] ; \quad A_{44} =
     A_{55} = \pi\rho\int\left(z-z_{cb}\right)R^2(z)dz;\quad A_{66} = 0.0;

where :math:`\rho` is the water density, :math:`R(z)` is the column
radius along its axis, and :math:`V` is the submerged volume. The extra
factor of :math:`1/2` in :math:`A_{33}` is included to account for the
fact that the top of the column extends above the waterline. Also, the
integral in :math:`A_{55}` is only evaluated along the submerged portion
of the column.

The stiffness matrix is comprised of contributions from the mooring and
hydrostatic stiffness. The mooring linearized stiffness matrix is output
directly from `MAP++ <https://nwtc.nrel.gov/MAP>`_ and needs no additional processing within
*FloatingSE*. The hydrostatic stiffness, for a vertical column, is
derived from the same principals described above regarding the
metacentric height,

   K_{ii} = K_{ii}^{moor} + K_{ii}^{hydro};\quad K_{33}^{hydro} = \rho g
     S_{sys};\quad K_{44}^{hydro} =  K_{55}^{hydro} = \rho g V h_{meta}

where :math:`S_{sys}` is the waterplane area of the system.

Once the rigid body natural frequencies (eigenmodes) of the system are
calculated, they are compared against the standard wave frequencies
range, , and expressed as a design constraint (with a partial safety
factor).
