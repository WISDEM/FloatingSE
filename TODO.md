- Inject manufacturing realism that ordering large quantities of constant thickness steel is cheaper than lots of individual orders of slightly varying thickness
- Allow for more complicated wave and hydrodynamic loads
- Move to mass, damper, and stiffness matrices for 6DOF dynamics
- Incorporate mooring into frame calculation
- Taught moorings- angled, vertical
- Tension arms
- Heave plates on vertical cylinders
- Add horizontal cylinder/floaters
- Gravity anchors
- Get GA working
- Separate out fatigue and extreme loading
- Allow for change in materials- concrete (pre/post tensioned), carbon fiber, different steel alloys
- Do summation of moments of inertia along with mass
- Give totals of mass with and without mooring system
- All floating turbine assembly
