- Inject manufacturing realism that ordering large quantities of constant thickness steel is cheaper than lots of individual orders of slightly varying thickness
- Refactor spar.py and sparAssembly.py to allow for substructure to have multiple cylindrical columns
- Create a semiAssembly.py that gets sized for bouyancy just with columns
- Add truss connections between columns that is analyzed with pyFrame3DD
- Allow for more complicated wave and hydrodynamic loads
- Allow for change in materials
