- Allow for more complicated wave and hydrodynamic loads
- Move to mass, damper, and stiffness matrices for 6DOF dynamics
- Tension arms from API 2V
- Add horizontal cylinder/floaters
- Gravity anchors
- DLC inputs as vector
- Allow for change in materials- concrete (pre/post tensioned), carbon fiber, different steel alloys
- Rename base->main and auxiliary->offset
- Simplify assemblies- use promote * more.
- Create OffshoreBOS group that has independent variables in it
- Rename ballast_heave_box to buoyancy_tank
- Write converter for old save files to new save files after name changes
