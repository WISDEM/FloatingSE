\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
This document serves as both a User Manual and Theory Guide for
\textit{FloatingSE}, one of multiple modules within the Wind-Plant Integrated
System Design and Engineering Model (WISDEM).  WISDEM is a set of
integrated modules that creates a virtual, vertically integrated wind
plant. The models use engineering principles for conceptual design and
preliminary analysis, and link to financial modules for LCOE estimation.
The WISDEM modules, including \textit{FloatingSE}, are built around the OpenMDAO
library, an open-source high-performance computing platform for systems
analysis and multidisciplinary optimization, written in Python
\citep{openmdao}.  This allows for the modules to be exercised
individually for component analysis or in unison for turbine or plant
level studies.
