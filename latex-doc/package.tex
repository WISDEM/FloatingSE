\chapter{Package Documentation}
\label{sec:package}
\textit{FloatingSE} is a module within the larger WISDEM project,
developed primarily by engineers at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL).  \textit{FloatingSE} is open-source and the project
repository is housed on GitHub at
\url{https://github.com/WISDEM/FloatingSE}.

\section{Package Files}
The files that comprise the \textit{FloatingSE} package are found in the
\texttt{src/floatingse} directory in accordance with standard Python
package conventions.  In addition to these files, there are also
affiliated unit tests that probe the behavior of individual functions.
These are located in the \texttt{test} sub-directory.  A summary of all
package files is included in Table \ref{tbl:package}.

\section{Dependencies}
\subsection{Python Dependencies}
\textit{FloatingSE} directly loads python modules from NumPy, SciPy,
OpenMDAO, and other WISDEM modules.  Each of these packages have
dependencies in their own right.  For visualization, there are optional
calls to Matplotlib and Mayavi.  All of the python dependencies are free
and open-source.

\subsection{WISDEM Dependencies}
The basic functioning of \textit{FloatingSE} relies heavily on \textit{CommonSE}, another
WISDEM module that has general utilities applicable across the WISDEM
suite.  To do a structural analysis on the entire floating turbine
structure, some OpenMDAO Components from \textit{TowerSE} are also called
directly.  In turn, other utilities managed within WISDEM are also
called, such as \textit{Akima} (for differentiable splines), and \textit{pyFrame3DD} (for
structural analysis).  Note that for these other WISDEM modules,
additional Python packages are required, as well as C and Fortran compilers.
