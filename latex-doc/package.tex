\section{Package Documentation}
\label{sec:package}
The open-source GitHub repository for \textit{FloatingSE} is located at
\url{https://github.com/WISDEM/FloatingSE}.  \textit{FloatingSE} is one of many
modules in the larger WISDEM project and developed primarily by
engineers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

\subsection{Package Files}
The files that comprise the \textit{FloatingSE} package are found in the
\texttt{src/floatingse} directory in accordance with standard Python
package conventions.  The main \textit{FloatingSE} files are,

{\small
  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{ l X }
    \textbf{File name} & \textbf{Description} \\
\texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py} & Generic python package file.\\
\texttt{column.py} & OpenMDAO Components and Group calculating
  mass, buoyancy, and static stability of frustum columns.\\
\texttt{floating.py} & Top level \textit{FloatingSE} OpenMDAO Group.\\
\texttt{floatingInstance.py} & Parent class controlling
  optimization drivers, constraints, and visualization. \\
\texttt{floating\_loading.py} & OpenMDAO Components and Group for
  Frame3DD analysis of complete turbine structure and final summation of
  mass and displacement.\\
\texttt{mapMooring.py} & Mooring analysis.\\
\texttt{semiInstance.py} & Semisubmersible example implementing
  OC4 design parameters, optimization, and visualization.\\
\texttt{sparInstance.py} & Spar example implementing OC3 design
  parameters, optimization, and visualization.\\
\texttt{substructure.py} & Final buoyancy and stability checks of
  the substructure.\\
\end{tabularx}
}

In addition to the individual files that comprise the package, there are
also unit tests that probe the behavior of individual functions.  These
are located in the \texttt{test} sub-directory.  These files are,

{\small
  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{ l X }
    \textbf{File name} & \textbf{Description} \\
\texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py} & Generic python package file.\\
\texttt{column\_PyU.py} & Tests for \texttt{column.py}.\\
\texttt{floating\_loading\_PyU.py} & Tests for \texttt{floating\_loading.py}.\\
\texttt{mapMooring\_PyU.py} & Tests for \texttt{mapMooring.py}.\\
\texttt{package\_PyU.py} & Convenience aggregator of all unit test files.\\
\texttt{substructure\_PyU.py} & Tests for \texttt{substructure.py}.\\
\end{tabularx}
}

\subsection{WISDEM Dependencies}
The basic functioning of \textit{FloatingSE} relies heavily on \textit{CommonSE}, another
WISDEM module that has general utilities applicable across the WISDEM
suite.  To do a structural analysis on the entire floating turbine
structure, some OpenMDAO Components from \textit{TowerSE} are also called
directly.  In turn, other utilities managed within WISDEM are also
called, such as \textit{Akima} (for differentiable splines), and \textit{pyFrame3DD} (for
structural analysis)
